# Password-Generator-9000

A password generator site.
User is prompted with a pop-up asking for the wanted password length (mandatory: between 8-128 characters), user is then prompted for which characters they
would like in their password: lowercase, uppercase, numbers and special characters. If all of these options are declined, they have failed.
